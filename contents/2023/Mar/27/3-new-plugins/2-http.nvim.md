http.nvim should be your weapon of choice when making plugins that have to call out to remote HTTP services. It's implemented as a native Lua module, no curl or wget required! It currently allows you to send and receive data as Lua strings (which can contain anything, including non-text data). There is also support for downloading files to a local path. WebSocket support is planned.
