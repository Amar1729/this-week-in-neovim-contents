> The power of trees at your fingertips.

`mind.nvim` was a project started a while ago by [@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon) to be able to put _thoughts_ in
tree-like structures. The project gained some traction, but lately, [@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon) started to
rework the project as a standalone and experimental tool. Having those features available only to Neovim started to
sound off and not the direction _phaazon_ wants his software to go to.

For this reason, `mind.nvim` is now archived. You are advised to switch to another plugin if you are doing any kind of
note taking or task management. The plugin was written with a BSD-3-Clause license, so feel free to fork it according to
the license.
