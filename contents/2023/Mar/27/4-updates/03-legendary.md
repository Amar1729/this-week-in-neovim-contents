`legendary.nvim` now has an extensions API, so users can automatically load keymaps/commands/etc. managed by other 
plugins into `legendary.nvim`'s registry, so that they can be triggered from `legendary.nvim`'s UI. For example, to load 
all of `nvim-tree.lua`'s keymaps into `legendary.nvim`, all you have to do now is add the following configuration:

```lua
require('legendary').setup({
  extensions = {
    nvim_tree = true,
  },
})
```

There are a few built-in extensions currently, and 3rd party extensions can also be added by creating a Lua module under 
the `legendary.extensions.*` namespace. See the 
[documentation](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim/blob/master/doc/EXTENSIONS.md) for more information.
