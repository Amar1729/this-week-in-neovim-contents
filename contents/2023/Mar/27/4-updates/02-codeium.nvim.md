> Unofficial Codeium Nvim Plugin

There have been several contributions from users of the plugin:

- [@WillEhrendreich] and [@ww-daniel-mora] helped to get the plugin working on Windows.
- [@luismeyer95] and [@dakata1337] reduced the spamminess of errors.
- [@DieracDelta], [@chrisgrieser], and [@mauriciopoppe] fixed various bugs.

Thanks everyone! On top of all these great contributions, optional support for [http.nvim](#http.nvim) has been added (see the readme).
