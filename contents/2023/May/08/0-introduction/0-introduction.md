# [Important disclaimer](#disclaimer) {#disclaimer}

This release marks the release of three different TWiN releases all merged as one:

- Monday April 24th 2023
- Monday May 1st 2023
- Monday May 8th 2023

I — [@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon) — was not available for a whole week (work summit in New-York) and missed two
release dates. Hence, you get a mega update this week, yaaaay.

However, I think it’s important for me to explain something about
[this-week-in-neovim](https://this-week-in-neovim.org). I started the project almost one year ago now, completely on my
own, just after asking the community whether they would like a curated list of news
([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/vu7ktl/suggestion_would_you_like_a_twinpe_this_week_in/)).

People might have noticed — should they know me directly or not — that I have moved away from Neovim. I will not explain
why (I plan on writing a blog article about it), but the thing is, my only binding to Neovim now is TWiN. I keep smiling
when reading new plugins, updates, guides and the thriving ecosystem, but it’s been a long time I’ve given up on the
direction of state of things of Neovim.

For this reason, I think it’s important to start talking about the future of TWiN. Hence, I’ll start with a Reddit thread
to gather what people want, who would like to get involved more (i.e. having write accesses, etc.) to slowly move
ownership. Let’s talk about that on Reddit; you have enough to read down below!

Have fun reading!
