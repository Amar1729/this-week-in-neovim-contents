Introducing `bufignore.nvim`, a efficient plugin that helps you keep your buffer list tidy by automatically unlisting hidden Git ignored files. If you've ever found yourself annoyed by a cluttered buffer list, for example, when working with files within .git or node_modules, then this plugin is for you.

Bufignore comes with several features to help keep your buffer in check, including efficient event processing, support for changing the current working directory, and a customizable callback function to further configure which buffers should be unlisted. It works out-of-the-box without the need for additional configuration.
