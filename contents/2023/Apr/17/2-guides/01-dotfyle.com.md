Introducing Dotfyle: a website to discover and share neovim configs.

How does it work?
- Sign up with GitHub and sync your Neovim config.
- The sync parses through the files in your GitHub repo to identify meta data about your config such as:
    - What plugins you have installed in your config.
    - What plugin manager you use.
    - What leader key you use (not yet working).

Additionally you can search for plugins, and see examples of configs that use that specific plugin.

Next steps:
- Act on feedback from `r/neovim`.
- Improve detection of plugins, plugin managers and features.
- Add "Trending plugin" detection based on usage changes.

Any additional feedback is greatly appreciated!
