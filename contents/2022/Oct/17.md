[`nvim-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/nvim-rs) is a rust library for writing rpc clients for neovim, utilizing the async/await language feature.

It allows to write GUIs that embed neovim (like [neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) and [gnvim](https://github.com/vhakulinen/gnvim)),
external clients (like [nvim-send](https://crates.io/crates/nvim-send)), or more standard plugins (like this
[port](https://github.com/KillTheMule/nvim-rs/blob/master/examples/scorched_earth.rs) of the iconic
[scorched earth](https://github.com/boxofrox/neovim-scorched-earth)).
