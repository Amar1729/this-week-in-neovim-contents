Pure lua replacement for [github/copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim). `Copilot.lua` has support for both Copilot Suggestion and
Copilot Panel, with custom keybindings and configurable settings. It also integrates nicely with other Lua plugins, e.g. `nvim-cmp`.

[`mini.map`](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-map.md) is a part of
[`mini.nvim`](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) library. Features include:

- Show and manage special floating window displaying automatically updated overview of current buffer text.
- Show scrollbar next to map content.
- Highlight map lines representing certain data in current buffer. There are pre-built generators for common integrations:
    - Builtin search.
    - Builtin diagnostic.
    - Git line status.
- Focus on map window to quickly browse current (source) buffer. Moving inside map window updates cursor position in source window
  enabling fast and targeted buffer exploration.
- Customizable:
    - Encoding symbols used to display binary information of different resolution (default is 3x2).
    - Scrollbar symbols, separate for line and view. Can have any width (even zero, which virtually disables scrollbar).
    - Integrations producing map line highlights.
    - Window options: side (left/right), width, 'winblend', and more.
