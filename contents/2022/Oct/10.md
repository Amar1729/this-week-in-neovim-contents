# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

Here are some mappings which help you with fixing spelling mistakes while writing.
These mappings are all made for insert mode.

You can use <kbd><c-g>u<Esc>[s1z=`]a<c-g>u</kbd> to fix your last spelling mistake automatically (builtin spell checking).

You can use <kbd><ESC>b~hea</kbd> at the end of a word to change the case of the word.

With <kbd><esc>blgulhea</kbd> you can (at the end of a word) make the second letter of the word lowercase.
With that you can correct spelling mistakes like NEovim to Neovim.
